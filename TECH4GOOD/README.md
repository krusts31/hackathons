Tech4Good Hackathon

THE GOAL:
	<a href="https://energiesprong.org"/>Energiesprong</a> would therefore like to develop an application and/or dashboard that makes it easy for homeowners to understand what is needed to renovate their homes to a level whereby fossil fuel is no longer needed.

Lets get going!

##	IDEA FOR THE APP

We believe everyone should get a net-zero house and we want to make sure as many people as possible can afford it. Today we have pictures showcasing a home analysis tool, home improvement environment and online marketplace together. Our app improved https://www.verbeterjehuis.nl with more in depth questions about specifics, we give the option to upload images to create a digital twin for the technicians not to have to go to site but to be able to do it from office. This saves time, resources and cost. Last but not least we offer an interactive budget planner and interactive profile. We have an interactive profile where the goal is to reach 100%! Inspired by social media profiles. An interactive display where you can play with different options for your house to see how much cash you would save, the amount of CO2 you save, the value your property increases and the return time of your investment. This is all based on the information you gave on your house to make the calculations as accurate as possible. Our app gives notifications about your digital twin, about new subsidies for your dream house or a new deal from a manufacturer. First we would be matching people with contractors by using technicians to analyse the images uploaded, so that would save time for the technician going on site, the analysis could be done from office. 
The abilities to expand our app are endless! One option is adding the ability to analyse images by creating a database with images to recognize household items used in heating, insulation and electricity. We would use python as an image recognition analysis tool and by using www.spotr.ai API, which analyzes the size of the house and labels objects to help users get an estimate for their roof size and window size. Another option is getting collaborations with banks to offer higher mortgages for homeowners to make their house future proof and showing these mortgages in the app. We have lots of ideas but saw the importance of keeping the main concept simple.
