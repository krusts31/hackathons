# GEI_hackathon

In this hackathon we analysed a scenario where a company has gathered data from 100'000 employees, to spot potential discriminations.

X axis is USD earned anualy.
Y axis work experience in years.

Our graphs, generaited by excel, reflect that after 12 years of experience people one avrage who study and work earn more money than thoes who work but don't studie.

The data also reflects that <b>non-male students</b> earn almost <b>twice as much</b> as <b>non-female students<b/>.
